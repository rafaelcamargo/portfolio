At the moment I finished to write my last post about [elements with multiple borders using pure CSS](https://rafaelcamargo.com/blog/elements-with-multiple-borders-using-pure-css/), I kept wondering how productive it would be if there were an online tool that aid programmers and designers to create and visualize multiple borders elements. Since I haven't found any, I decided to create [Bordiple](https://bordiple.rafaelcamargo.com/).

_Preview and share your creations with ease_

Likewise online tools used to generate CSS gradients, the idea behind Bordiple is to make the development of multiple border elements easier through a friendly interface that allows any person to create, visualize and copy the CSS code related to the generated borders. It's also possible to customize the preview area, making the necessary adjustments under the tab *Preferences*. At last, any creation can be seamlessly shared using the sharing link available under the tab *Share*.
