description: After discovering a service called Plausible in 2020, I started to remove Google Analytics from all my websites, one by one, until getting completely free of it in February of this year.

It was mid-2020 when I first heard about Plausible. That was a tweet by Jason Fried sharing the pros of the service, a web analytics tool. Jason highlighted Plausible's privacy-first approach to track the usage of a website. Unlike Google Analytics, Plausible doesn't use cookies e doesn't track people across their devices and across websites they visit. Plausible's goal is to track overall trends in a website traffic, is not to track its individual visitors.

Having liked what I had just discovered, I started to do some research about it. Then I was thrilled to learn that, whereas Google Analytics is already considered [illegal](https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-illegal) in several European countries, Plausible is compliant with [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) *(General Data Protection Regulation - E.U.)*, [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) *(California Consumer Privacy Act)*, and [PECR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guide-to-pecr/what-are-pecr/) *(Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations - U.K.)*.

I was pretty sure about the ethical superiority of Plausible over Google Analytics, but there was just a little issue. Google Analytics was free. Plausible cost six dollars a month. After doing the math and understanding that six dollars would be the total cost of using Plausible on all the websites I had at that time, and that it wouldn't increase while the number of page views for all my websites wasn't greater than 10k a month, I decided to make the leap. Later, after checking out the terrible UI of Google Analytics 4, I couldn't be more certain about my decision.

My personal website was the first one to get Plausible installed and, little by little, it got installed on all the other ones: [Pitsby](https://pitsby.compilorama.com), [Taslonic](https://taslonic.com), [Glorious Codes](https://glorious.codes). [Four-Day Week](https://4dayweek.rafaelcamargo.com) and [Bordiple](https://bordiple.rafaelcamargo.com) were already born in the post-Google Analytics era and, since their first visitor, had their traffic computed by Plausible. Before finishing, I have to say how impressed I got with the ability to make my open-source websites' analytics public. Now, at the footer of each website, I can state that visitors not only enjoy a cookie-free experience but also have access to the analytics of the website they are visiting.
