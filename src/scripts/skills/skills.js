                After working for over seven years as a graphic designer, I <b>
                started in 2013</b> my career as a programmer at one of the <b>most
                popular startups in Brazil</b>, where I ended up leading
                the <b>front-end</b> efforts in the <b> Design System</b> team.
              </p>
              <p>
                During that exciting period, I got fluent in
                the <b>latest JavaScript specifications</b>, several front-end
                technologies, and went deep in concepts that have shaped the
                way I write software. Among these concepts are <b>Clean Code
                </b>, <b>SOLID</b>, the <b>three laws of TDD</b>, and this <a

                I am very experienced with bundlers and task runners like <b>Gulp
                </b> and <b>Webpack</b>. Long experience building <b>Single Page
                Applications</b> since the old <b>AngularJS</b> until the
                modern <b>Vue</b> and <b>React</b>. I am very familiar with
                unit test tools like <b>Karma</b>, <b>Jasmine</b>, and <b>Jest</b>.
                Iâ€™m very familiar with a wide range of CSS preprocessors
                like <b>Sass</b>, <b>Less</b>, <b>PostCSS</b> and, mainly, <b>Stylus</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Topics other than front-end on which I have a good
                understanding include Continuous Integration tools like <b>
                Travis</b> and <b>CircleCI</b>. <b>Firebase</b>, <b>Netlify
                </b> and <b>AWS S3</b>, test coverage tools like <b>Coveralls
                </b> and <b>Codecov</b>, <b>HTTP</b> and <b>REST</b>. Also, I
                have a basic understanding of the following back-end
                technologies: <b>NodeJS</b>, <b>Express</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, <b>
